This code was created by Joseph Allen alongside George Chant in conjunction with the 'Advanced Techniques in LLMs' internship project.

The requirements file from George's folder will suffice.

The model builds include a basic rag, knowledge graph rag and a knowledge graph + multi-query retrieval rag.

*NOTE*
The knowledge graph jupyter notebook should be used prior to the knowledge graph .py file in order to create the knowledge graph first so that it can be accessed by the .py file.

Vector docs contains the pdfs used as a the knowledge base.

Ensure that neo4j desktop is installed to create the knowledge graph.
